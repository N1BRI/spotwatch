A minimal, mobile, <a href="https://www.reversebeacon.net/">Reverse Beacon</a> client. Spotwatch transforms the digital and CW Reverse Beacon telnet server streams into a user-friendly app. Spots are on a rolling buffer and can be viewed in a detailed list or plotted on a map (long-press or hover over the spot on the map for details). This was primarily envisioned as a tool for mobile operators to check realtime propagation conditions and ensure operators' signals are getting out, but will work on desktop too.
